            After college, I went to culinary school. At 25 I opened my first restaurant, which did pretty well for the three years we were open. At 30 I decided to go back to school to become a nurse. After receiving my bachelors degree in nursing, I was hired at Barnes Jewish Hospital on the Hepatobilliary Unit, in which my patients were mostly suffering from Pancreatic Cancer. While in nursing school I got married and had two children. As of recently I have been a stay at home dad, and again decided to change careers to coding. And also just recently had another child. So now we have a 7 year old daughter, 5 year old son, and 2 week old daughter.
